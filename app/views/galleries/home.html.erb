  Welcome to my website. Checkout functions on the banner!
</h2>
<p>
  This website is set up for my Ruby on Rails test. For upload/edit/delete photo and blog, it requires login. If you want to have a try,
  please contact me for further information.

  Currently two functions are provided: Gallery and  Blog. Gallery is fulfilled with Paperclip as backend, Galleria as frontend, Amazon S3 as storage.
  I plan to put some new functions like Twitter integration later.
